## Profile

My name is Song Wang, I was born in 1986 and I am 34 years old.

I have 10 years of programming development experience and 8 years of JavaScript development experience.
I did back-end development for Java and PHP in the early days, and later I focused on JavaScript and Node.js.

At present, I focus on front-end infrastructure and high-performance JavaScript, and I have in-depth research on V8 engine.
Since 2019, I have become Deno's core contributor.
